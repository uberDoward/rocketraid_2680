This is just where I'm keeping work while I ensure the v2.1 HPT Open Source drivers work with the latest kernels.

To use this, you gotta make from the product/linux directory.

Meh, maybe I'll update this more as I go...

Credit where credit is due - this is the culmination of a few days scouring the internet.  It's not all mine, but I did the final patching to get this to work with kernel>=4.8.

Currently working with:
Kernel <del>4.9.6</del> 4.9.16
